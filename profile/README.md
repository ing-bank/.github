[The ING Open Banking CLI](https://github.com/ing-bank/ing-open-banking-cli) is implemented with scripts.
These scripts can be used to test your connection to the ING sandbox for Open Banking APIs (Premium and PSD2).
It is your starting point to create wonderful apps using ING APIs!

[The ING Open Banking SDK](https://github.com/ing-bank/ing-open-banking-sdk)
With this SDK we provide the means to generate drivers to interact with ING's Open Banking APIs.
It includes a custom generator that creates drivers which encapsulate HTTP signature signing and OAuth application token flows.
